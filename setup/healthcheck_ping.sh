# OS-level Healthchecks.io heartbeat for vigil.
#
# Pings the system-level Healthchecks.io check every time it is called.
# Cron calls this every 5 minutes, independent of the Python application.
# If the Pi crashes, loses power, or the OS freezes, these pings stop
# and Healthchecks.io alerts the builder.
#
# Usage (manual test):
#   HEALTHCHECKS_SYSTEM_URL=https://hc-ping.com/<uuid> bash setup/healthcheck_ping.sh
#
# The URL is injected via environment variable from the crontab entry
# written by setup/install.sh.
